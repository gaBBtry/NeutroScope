# Product Vision: NeutroScope

## 1. What is NeutroScope?

NeutroScope is an interactive, educational desktop application designed to teach the fundamental and **advanced** principles of nuclear reactor physics. Originally a static visualization tool, it has evolved into a **dynamic temporal simulator** capable of modeling complex reactor kinetics and time-dependent phenomena. While not an engineering-grade simulation tool, it serves as a sophisticated yet accessible learning aid for students, trainees, and professionals at multiple levels of reactor physics education.

## 2. What Problem Does It Solve?

### Original Challenge (Solved)
The core concepts of reactor physics—such as criticality, reactivity, and the neutron lifecycle—are abstract and can be difficult to grasp from textbooks alone.

### Advanced Challenge (New Capability)
**Temporal reactor phenomena**—such as xenon poisoning dynamics, temperature feedback effects, and transient behavior—require understanding of complex interactions that develop over time. Traditional educational tools often cannot demonstrate these crucial real-world reactor behaviors.

NeutroScope now solves both challenges by providing a comprehensive "virtual reactor" where learners can:

-   **Visualize abstract concepts**: See how a population of neutrons evolves over a generation AND over time.
-   **Understand temporal dynamics**: Observe xenon concentration buildup, equilibrium states, and post-shutdown transients in real-time.
-   **Experiment safely**: Manipulate key reactor parameters (control rods, boron, temperature) and see both immediate AND time-delayed impacts on reactor stability.
-   **Explore advanced physics**: Study counter-effects of temperature (fuel Doppler + moderator effects), neutron poison dynamics, and sophisticated six-factor interactions.
-   **Build progressive knowledge**: Start with basic concepts (static criticality) and advance to complex temporal phenomena (xenon dynamics), all within the same coherent framework.

## 3. How Should It Work? (User Experience)

The user experience maintains its clarity while expanding to support sophisticated temporal simulations.

### Core Experience (Enhanced)
-   **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, modern UI with logical organization. Central neutron cycle visualization remains the focal point, enhanced with temporal displays.
-   **Real-time Feedback**: Every user action provides instant visual and numerical feedback, now including temporal evolution displays and time-dependent parameter tracking.
-   **Progressive Complexity**: Users can start with static simulations (immediate results) and advance to temporal simulations (time-dependent evolution) as their understanding grows.

### New Temporal Experience
-   **Time Controls**: Intuitive time advancement controls (1h, 6h, 12h, 24h) with visual progress tracking.
-   **Dynamic Visualizations**: Real-time plots showing xenon concentrations, reactivity evolution, and temporal correlations.
-   **Historical Context**: Visual history of reactor states and parameter evolution for comprehensive understanding.
-   **Reset Capabilities**: Easy return to equilibrium states for exploring different scenarios.

### Educational Excellence (Maintained & Enhanced)
-   **Universal Info-Bubble System**: Enhanced with temporal context - hovering over any element provides clear explanations including time-dependent behaviors.
-   **Guided Learning**: Expanded preset collection including temporal scenarios ("Xenon equilibrium operation", "Post-shutdown xenon peak").
-   **Physical Rigor**: All temporal models based on authentic reactor physics (Bateman equations, realistic cross-sections, actual PWR data).
