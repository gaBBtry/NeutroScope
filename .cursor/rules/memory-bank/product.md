# Product Vision: NeutroScope

## 1. What is NeutroScope?

NeutroScope is an interactive, educational desktop application designed to teach the fundamental principles of nuclear reactor physics. It is not an engineering-grade simulation tool, but a visual and intuitive learning aid for students, trainees, and anyone curious about nuclear energy.

## 2. What Problem Does It Solve?

The core concepts of reactor physics—such as criticality, reactivity, and the neutron lifecycle—are abstract and can be difficult to grasp from textbooks alone. NeutroScope solves this by providing a hands-on, "virtual reactor" where learners can:

-   **Visualize abstract concepts**: See how a population of neutrons evolves over a generation.
-   **Experiment safely**: Manipulate key reactor parameters (control rods, boron, temperature) and see the immediate impact on reactor stability.
-   **Build foundational knowledge**: Understand the cause-and-effect relationships that govern a reactor's behavior before moving on to more complex, real-world training simulators.

## 3. How Should It Work? (User Experience)

The user experience is paramount and must be guided by clarity, simplicity, and engagement.

-   **Intuitive Interface**: The UI is clean, modern, and organized logically. A central visualization of the neutron cycle is the main focus, with control panels arranged intuitively around it.
-   **Real-time Feedback**: Every user action—moving a slider, selecting a preset—provides instant visual and numerical feedback. The `k_eff` gauge, reactivity displays, and plots update immediately, reinforcing the learning loop.
-   **Educational Focus**: At every point, the application aims to teach. This is primarily achieved through the "universal info-bubble" system, where hovering over any element provides a clear, concise explanation of its purpose and physical meaning.
-   **Guided Learning**: Pre-defined scenarios ("presets") allow instructors or learners to jump directly into specific, relevant reactor states (e.g., startup, end-of-cycle) to study particular phenomena.

## 4. Target Audience

-   **Primary**: Students in nuclear engineering programs, trainees in the nuclear industry, and educators.
-   **Secondary**: Science and engineering enthusiasts, policymakers, and journalists who want a deeper understanding of nuclear principles.
