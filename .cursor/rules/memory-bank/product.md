# Product Vision: NeutroScope

## 1. What is NeutroScope?

NeutroScope is an advanced interactive educational desktop application designed to teach the fundamental and **advanced** principles of nuclear reactor physics. Originally conceived as a static visualization tool, it has evolved into a **sophisticated temporal simulator** capable of modeling complex reactor kinetics, time-dependent phenomena, and advanced preset management. While not an engineering-grade simulation tool, it serves as a comprehensive and professionally-grade learning aid for students, trainees, and professionals at multiple levels of reactor physics education.

## 2. What Problem Does It Solve?

### Original Challenge (Solved)
The core concepts of reactor physics—such as criticality, reactivity, and the neutron lifecycle—are abstract and can be difficult to grasp from textbooks alone.

### Advanced Challenge (Fully Addressed)
**Temporal reactor phenomena**—such as xenon poisoning dynamics, temperature feedback effects, and transient behavior—require understanding of complex interactions that develop over time. Traditional educational tools often cannot demonstrate these crucial real-world reactor behaviors.

### Educational Management Challenge (Newly Solved)
**Scenario management and educational continuity**—instructors need sophisticated tools to create, organize, and share reactor scenarios for different learning levels. Students need to progress through structured learning paths with appropriate complexity levels.

NeutroScope now comprehensively solves all these challenges by providing a complete "virtual reactor laboratory" where learners can:

-   **Visualize abstract concepts**: See how a population of neutrons evolves over a generation AND over time with detailed visual feedback.
-   **Understand temporal dynamics**: Observe xenon concentration buildup, equilibrium states, and post-shutdown transients in real-time with dual-axis plotting.
-   **Experiment safely**: Manipulate key reactor parameters (control rods, boron, temperature) and see both immediate AND time-delayed impacts on reactor stability.
-   **Explore advanced physics**: Study counter-effects of temperature (fuel Doppler + moderator effects), neutron poison dynamics, and sophisticated six-factor interactions.
-   **Manage learning scenarios**: Create, organize, and share advanced preset configurations with comprehensive metadata and categorization.
-   **Track temporal states**: Save and restore complex reactor states including poison concentrations and simulation history.
